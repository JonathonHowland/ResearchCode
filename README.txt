This is a repository housing the code I used in my undergraduate research. As it was originally designed as a backup, it is not optimized to be read by anyone who doesn't understand it.

In order to run most of the .C files, you will need to install ROOT, a collection of C++ libraries for data analysis in HEP physics. It can be installed from https://root.cern.ch

Depending on which file you try to run, you may also need to install RestFrames, which is a collection of C++ libraries designed to help analyze and visualize particle decays. It can be found at restframes.com

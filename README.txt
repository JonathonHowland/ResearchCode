This is a repository housing the code I used in my undergraduate research. As it was originally designed as a backup, it is not optimized to be read by anyone who doesn't understand it.

In order to run most of the .C files, you will need to install ROOT, a collection of C++ libraries for data analysis in HEP physics. It can be installed from https://root.cern.ch
